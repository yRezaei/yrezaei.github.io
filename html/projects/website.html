                    <h2>Personal Website Project Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        For a long time, I've been wanting to build a personal website that reflects who I am and
                        what I do.
                        This platform is intended to showcase my work, share insights from my career journey, and
                        provide a
                        space
                        to explore the advanced software engineering practices I’ve learned through Robotics, the
                        Automotive
                        industry, and various system engineering applications.

                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Section discussing project structure and openness -->
            <section class="section" style="position: relative;">
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h2>Project Structure & Future Growth</h2>
                    <p>
                        Although this is my first ever project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’ve organized it to
                        separate
                        content
                        from layout and logic. Each core module, page, or script lives in its own file, while
                        essential data
                        is
                        stored in JSON under <code>assets/data/*.json</code>. This approach makes the site more
                        readable,
                        maintainable, and easily extendable over time. If anyone likes this structure, they can
                        freely take
                        (“fork”) this entire project, swap in their own data files, and publish a personal website
                        with
                        minimal
                        effort. It’s all open and free of charge to use as a starting point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, I plan to refine this structure so it’s even simpler to maintain: most CSS will
                        be
                        consolidated
                        into more generic files, and new features will be added without impacting existing
                        functionality.
                        The goal
                        is that anyone can simply tweak the JSON content for their personal data, pick a suitable
                        CSS theme,
                        and
                        have a complete site ready to go.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Simple conceptual diagram to visually explain the structure -->
            <section class="section">
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h2>Visual Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Below is a quick glimpse of some core folders in the project (trimmed for brevity). Each
                        folder has
                        a distinct purpose,
                        so it’s easy to extend or customize your personal site:

                    <p>
                        Want to add a new feature or page? Here’s the basic process:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Add a New Data Entry:</strong> Update the relevant JSON file in
                            <code>assets/data</code>
                            with
                            your new item (e.g., a new project or blog post).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Create or Update an HTML Page:</strong> Place your new page in the
                            <code>html</code>
                            folder, then
                            reference it in the JSON so the site can automatically link to it.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Style It:</strong> Add or modify a <code>.css</code> file to suit your needs, or
                            incorporate
                            new styles into <code>styles.css</code> if they’re reusable.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript Logic:</strong> If needed, create a dedicated <code>.js</code> file
                            or update
                            an existing one to fetch data and render it on the page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reuse & Fork:</strong> The entire project is free to use. If you like this
                            structure,
                            feel free
                            to fork the

                            replace
                            the JSON files
                            with your own content, and have a personal website up in no time!
