                      Hey there! I’m Yashar—software engineer by profession, builder by
                      nature, and someone who believes that true joy comes from sharing life
                      with the people you love.

                      I’ve always been drawn to figuring out how things work. Whether I’m
                      designing and building my own kitchen cabinets or repairing a broken
                      appliance, there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of watching
                      something I crafted (or fixed) come to life. I’ll happily lose myself
                      in a DIY project, diving into videos and research about tools,
                      materials, and the science behind them.

                      Professionally, I’m a senior software engineer who thrives on solving
                      complex problems and creating innovative solutions. I’ve worked across
                      various industries—robotics, automotive, distributed systems—and love the
                      challenge of diving into new projects that expand my skill set. Looking
                      ahead, I’m aiming to grow into a solutions architect or engineering leader,
                      steering projects from concept to reality. I’m also keen on exploring new
                      ideas that can make a meaningful impact, continuously learning and adapting
                      to keep pace with the ever-evolving tech world.

                      I’m an early bird, up around 7 a.m. every morning (though bedtime tends
                      to fall closer to midnight). Each day starts with coffee, feeding my cat,
                      and a quick check of my little garden. I like to keep my schedule
                      semi-flexible, juggling work, family time, and personal projects. After
                      a long day, I’ll often unwind with a hot cup of tea—then I’m back at it,
                      chipping away at whatever goal I’m currently chasing.

                      I’m fortunate to share life’s ups and downs with my wonderful wife,
                      Mozhgan. She’s the best part of my day, and our relationship keeps me
                      focused on what truly matters: loyalty, love, and mutual support. I’m
                      also someone who values friendships deeply. I enjoy the camaraderie of the
                      office, diving into small talk, and hearing about people’s own journeys.
                      Even after moving abroad and building a new life in Germany, I keep finding
                      ways to connect, laugh, and create new memories with friends—old and new.

                    <p>
                      I was born in Karaj, near Tehran, but my family hails from Tabriz, a city
                      known for its hardworking and business-minded culture. Growing up there
                      taught me that real progress comes from dedication and discipline—nobody
                      hands you anything on a silver platter. I still cherish the traditions of
                      visiting elders during the Iranian New Year and gathering with relatives
                      to celebrate cultural events.

                    <p>
                      I believe that what fuels success is determination. Nothing in life is
                      free, and while knowledge might be at our fingertips, applying it takes
                      serious effort. I’m all for lending a hand—whether it’s helping a friend
                      move forward in a meaningful way or guiding someone to solve a tough
                      problem. But I also think money alone doesn’t solve anything in the long
                      run; it’s about mindset, resilience, and taking ownership of your path.

                      At the heart of everything I do is my dedication. No matter what I face—a
                      complex coding challenge, a demanding DIY project, or simply the ups and
                      downs of life—I rely on resilience and discipline. I keep my eyes on the
                      finish line and push forward, fueled by the satisfaction of seeing a
                      project completed or an idea brought to life.

                      When I’m not coding or tinkering, you’ll likely find me hitting the gym
                      or enjoying a competitive round of FIFA. I’m fairly spontaneous with
                      plans—though I like to have a rough outline for big goals, I don’t sweat
                      the tiny details of what I’ll be doing a decade from now. I’m a dreamer,
                      sure, but I keep my feet on the ground (even if I sometimes indulge in
                      flights of fancy, courtesy of the games and animations I love).

                      Looking ahead, I see myself expanding both my personal life and my
                      professional horizons: maybe a big house with a garden (to host epic
                      gatherings of friends), a chance to lead innovative projects, and perhaps
                      a dream yacht for summer adventures. Through it all, I’ll keep
                      building—whether it’s cabinets, software, or relationships—because that’s
                      where I find my purpose.
